# Machine learning to forecast the onset of Diabetes in women
This project used ML algorithms like Logistic regression, Decision trees and the k-NN to classify patients as likely/un-likely to be diagnosed with Diabetes mellitus. The models were trained on the data collected from female patients at least 21 years and of Pima Indian heritage. The parameters for each model was tuned using grid search along with 3-fold cross-validation and the final models performance metrics were compared on the test set.
